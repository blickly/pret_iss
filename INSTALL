More instructions on installation, compiling, and executing examples is documented in $PRET_ISS/doc/pret_simulator.html. 


Compiling PRET without SystemC
---------------------------------------
-- Must set environment variable PRET_ISS (example with
bash shell)
-- Note that `pwd` returns the current directory path
$ export PRET_ISS=`pwd`
$ ./configure 
$ make


Compiling PRET with SystemC
------------------------------------
-- Must set environment variables SYSTEMC and PRET_ISS (example with
bash shell)
$ export SYSTEMC=<path-to-systemc>
-- Note that `pwd` returns the current directory path
$ export PRET_ISS=`pwd`
$ ./configure --enable-systemc 
$ make


Compiling PRET's debugger
-------------------------
-- By default the debugger is built. 
-- To disable use flag --disable-debugger.
$ ./configure --disable-debugger

Running the simulator
---------------------

The pret executable is compiled in src/. The arguments for the
simulator are a file name followed by a cycle number. The file name
points to a file that contains the directory with the SREC files. The
cycle number is optional and used to run the simulator for that many
number of cycles. The file pointed by file name only needs the
directory path.

Examples
-----------------
Three examples are provided with this release. They are:

+ janne: A multimedia algorithm,
+ smile : An example using timing instructions that produce a smiley
          face,
+ sync_example_cases: A mutual exclusion example using timing instructions,
+ graphic: The video game graphic drawing.

Running the Examples
---------------------

There are two steps in running the examples. The first is to compile
the example, and the second is to use the PRET simulator to execute
the compiled binaries. We provide a script
($PRET_ISS/scripts/compile_threads.py) that takes the directory as an
argument to compile the example. Executing the simulator takes two
arguments: the directory of the compiled binaries and the number of
cycles to execute the simulator.

Procedure to run smile example:
$ cd $PRET_ISS
$ ./scripts/compile_threads.py examples/smile
$ src/pret examples/smile -1

Alternatively, the debugger can be used to execute the example as well.
$ cd $PRET_ISS
$ ./scripts/compile_threads.py examples/smile
$ ./scripts/csim  examples/smile
csim> run -1


Compiling Source from SVN 
------------------------------------
-- Must execute boostrap.sh before compiling PRET as mentioned above.
$ ./bootstrap.sh
