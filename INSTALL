Compiling PRET from CVS without SystemC
---------------------------------------
$ ./bootstrap.sh
-- Must set environment variable PRET_ISS (example with
bash shell)
-- Note that `pwd` returns the current directory path
$ export PRET_ISS=`pwd`
$ ./configure 
$ make


Compiling PRET from CVS with SystemC
------------------------------------
$ ./bootstrap.sh
-- Must set environment variables SYSTEMC and PRET_ISS (example with
bash shell)
$ export SYSTEMC=<path-to-systemc>
-- Note that `pwd` returns the current directory path
$ export PRET_ISS=`pwd`
$ ./configure --enable-systemc 
$ make


Compiling PRET's debugger
-------------------------
-- Use flag --enable-debugger to compile the debugger.
$ ./configure --enable-debugger

Running the simulator
---------------------

The pret executable is compiled in src/. The arguments for the
simulator are a file name followed by a cycle number. The file name
points to a file that contains the directory with the SREC files. The
cycle number is optional and used to run the simulator for that many
number of cycles. The file pointed by file name only needs the
directory path.

Test simulator
--------------
$ cd tests
$ source exports.sh
$ ./scripts/verify.pl pret/core/instruction/test0.cpp

Execute Quick Test Suite
------------------------
These are a subset of the full regression suite that can be used for a sanity check when
adding functionalities that potentially affect the behavior.

$ source tests/exports.sh
$ make quick_tests

Execute Regression Suite
------------------------
$ source tests/exports.sh
$ make regression
