Execute Tests
--------------

- Edit exports.sh and update the paths in it according to the system's
install paths. The paths that need to be populated are SYSTEMC_HOME
with the path for where SystemC is installed and RT_ADD_LDLIBS with
the path of where libpretcore.a is available. 

$ source exports.sh
$ ./scripts/verify.pl pret/core/instruction/test0.cpp
